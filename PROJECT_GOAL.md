## The Goal (Simple Version)

**What it does**: A single-file fitness dashboard that gives your fitness coach exactly what they need to guide your training, nutrition, and recovery decisions in weekly coaching sessions.

**The Core Objectives**:
1. **Surface coaching insights** - Transform raw WHOOP, MacroFactor, and measurement data into actionable coaching intelligence
2. **Enable fast data entry** - CLI tool that takes 60 seconds for daily check-ins, 5 minutes for weekly summaries
3. **Zero friction deployment** - Single HTML file, GitHub Pages hosting, $0/month, no backend

## How It Integrates With Your Existing Systems

### Your Current Ecosystem

```
WHOOP (Wearable)
├── Tracks: HRV, RHR, sleep, strain, recovery
├── Exports: CSV or manual data pull
└── Provides: Physiological readiness signals

MacroFactor (App)
├── Tracks: Calories, protein, carbs, fats
├── Exports: Weekly summary or manual entry
└── Provides: Nutrition adherence data

Fitness Coach (Human)
├── Needs: Weekly overview of client metrics
├── Views: Phone/desktop during coaching calls
└── Outputs: Coaching recommendations and adjustments
```

### What This Project Adds

```
Coach Dashboard (NEW)
├── index.html: Single-file dashboard with Chart.js visualizations
├── coach-ingest CLI: Interactive data entry tool (Python)
└── data/: JSON storage for weekly and daily data

Integrations:
├── Reads from: WHOOP exports, MacroFactor data, manual measurements
├── Writes to: JSON files → embedded in dashboard HTML
├── Visualized by: 6 Chart.js charts + Coach Session Prep summary
└── Improves: Coach's ability to spot patterns and guide decisions
```

## Concrete Example: How It Works

### Scenario: Weekly Coaching Call Preparation

**Without This Project**:
1. Coach asks "How was your week?" - relies on athlete's memory
2. No visual trends - coach can't see HRV/sleep patterns at a glance
3. Inconsistent data - some weeks have numbers, some don't
4. 10-15 minutes reviewing scattered screenshots/messages
5. Outcome: Coaching based on incomplete picture

**With This Project**:
1. Athlete runs `coach-ingest checkin` daily (60 seconds)
2. Sunday: `coach-ingest whoop && coach-ingest nutrition && coach-ingest weekly`
3. Dashboard shows "Client Readiness: At Risk" with specific blockers
4. Charts reveal HRV trending down, sleep deficit accumulating
5. Coach Session Prep suggests: "Sleep optimization - 5.7h avg vs 8h target"
6. Outcome: Data-driven coaching decisions in under 2 minutes

### Next Similar Use Case

The system accumulates weekly data files in `data/weeks/`, enabling:
- Week-over-week trend comparison (future feature)
- Seasonal pattern recognition
- Long-term progress tracking
- Historical context for plateaus or breakthroughs

## Why This Matters For Your Workflow

### Current Pain Points (That This Project Solves)

1. **Scattered data across apps**
   - Current: WHOOP app, MacroFactor app, text messages, memory
   - **This Project**: Single dashboard aggregates everything in one view

2. **No coaching-specific insights**
   - Current: Raw numbers require mental processing
   - **This Project**: "Coach Session Prep" section highlights blockers, suggests topics, shows wins

3. **Time-consuming data review**
   - Current: 10-15 minutes piecing together weekly picture
   - **This Project**: 30-second glance reveals client status

4. **Inconsistent weekly logs**
   - Current: Some weeks detailed, some weeks nothing
   - **This Project**: CLI prompts ensure consistent data capture

## Integration Points Summary

| Your System | This Project Uses It For |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| **WHOOP** | HRV, RHR, sleep, strain, recovery metrics |
| **MacroFactor** | Calorie and macro tracking vs targets |
| **Body measurements** | Weight, waist, chest tracking |
| **Daily check-ins** | Mood, energy, blockers, wins |
| **GitHub Pages** | Free, zero-maintenance hosting |

## What Success Looks Like (6 Months From Now)

**Current state**: Manual data sharing, inconsistent tracking, coaching based on memory

**Future state with This Project**:
- 24 weeks of consistent weekly data captured
- Coach can pull up any week's dashboard in seconds
- Clear patterns visible: "Sleep under 6h correlates with low recovery"
- Blockers logged and addressed systematically
- Wins celebrated and reinforced
- Data-driven adjustments to training/nutrition plans

## Key Questions Answered

**Q: Does this align with WWSJD (What Would Steve Jobs Do)?**
A: Yes - this is the elegant solution. Original proposal: Node.js + Express + React + Railway = 2-4 weeks, $15/month. Elegant solution: HTML + Chart.js + CLI + GitHub Pages = 2-4 hours, $0/month. We removed 95% of complexity while delivering 100% of the value.

**Q: Do you want to start small or full implementation?**
A: Start small, iterate. V1 is a single HTML file with embedded data. V2 (in `/v2/` folder) adds authentication for multi-client scenarios. Build only what's needed, ship fast, learn from usage.

**Q: Integration preference?**
A: Zero-infrastructure by design. No backend, no database, no build pipeline. The CLI writes JSON files, the HTML reads them. Git is the deployment mechanism. This is intentionally low-tech to minimize failure modes and maintenance burden.
